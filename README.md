# Avalanche


Avalanche is a framework for Xamarin apps which tightly integrate with Rock Rms. It is designed for administrators who are used to administrating Rock, and developers who are used to developing Rock. Concepts like pages, blocks, lava and users translate 1 to 1 in the app. The goal is to create an app which is flexible and meets the needs of churches of all sizes.

Avalanche currently powers the Southeast Christian Church app, with other non-profits' apps in development.
